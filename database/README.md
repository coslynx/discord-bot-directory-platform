## 📍 Overview
This repository houses the "Discord Bot Directory Platform," a comprehensive web application designed to connect Discord bot developers with potential users. It provides a centralized directory for bot listings, robust moderation tools for administrators, and a user-friendly interface for both developers and users.  Built using React, MUI, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, this platform prioritizes scalability, maintainability, and a seamless user experience.

## 📦 Features

This platform offers a rich set of features categorized for clarity:

For Bot Developers:

- Bot Submission:  Submit detailed bot information including description, commands, features, and links (GitHub, website).
- Bot Editing: Update existing bot listings to ensure accuracy and keep information current.
- Bot Deletion: Remove bots from the directory.
- Profile Management: Manage account settings, linked bots, and overall profile information.

For Administrators:

- Bot Approval/Rejection: Review and approve or reject submitted bot listings based on predefined guidelines and terms of service.
- Bot Moderation:  Edit listings, address reported issues, remove bots violating platform rules, and maintain the integrity of the bot directory.
- User Management: Create, modify, and manage user accounts and roles, controlling their permissions within the system.
- Analytics Dashboard:  Provides real-time and historical data on bot submissions, user activity, and platform usage trends. This informs strategic decisions and monitors platform health.
- Configuration Settings: Fine-tune platform behavior, including approval processes, notification frequencies, and display settings.

Core Platform Features:

- Bot Metrics Display: Dynamically displays key performance indicators (KPIs) for listed bots, including uptime, guild count, and user count.  Provides users with vital information to assess bot performance and reliability.
- Notification System:  Ensures efficient communication.  Includes Discord bot notifications (sent to a pre-configured channel) and direct message notifications (sent to users regarding their submitted bots).  The system is configurable to avoid spamming.

## 📂 Structure

The project utilizes a monorepo structure for efficient management of both frontend and backend code:

```

## 💻 Installation

Prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm (or yarn)
- MongoDB (local instance or cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas)

Steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [YOUR_GITHUB_URL]`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd discord-bot-directory-platform`
3. Install frontend dependencies: `cd frontend && npm install`
4. Install backend dependencies: `cd ../backend && npm install`
5. Configure environment variables:  Create `.env` files in both `frontend` and `backend` directories with appropriate configurations (refer to `.env.example` if provided).  This includes database connection strings, API keys, and other sensitive information.

## 🏗️ Usage

1. Start the backend server: `cd backend && npm start`
2. Start the frontend development server: `cd ../frontend && npm start`

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (frontend port may vary depending on your configuration).

## 🌐 Hosting

This application is designed for deployment on a cloud platform such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.  Containerization using Docker is recommended for ease of deployment.

Deployment Steps (Example using Heroku):

1. Create a Heroku account and install the Heroku CLI.
2. Create a new Heroku app.
3. Push your code to the Heroku remote:  `git push heroku main` (or equivalent branch).
4. Configure your Heroku app's environment variables to match the contents of your local `.env` file.
